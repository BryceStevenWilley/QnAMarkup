			Q(1.1.1.1): Are you thinking about a separation?

				A: I want a legal separation agreement.

				A: I want to learn more about my options.
					Q(1.1.1.1.1.2): There is a court process that continues your married status but enters a final order that divides marital property and debt, provides a parenting plan and child support order.  This process is used by people who want to remain legally married to protect significant religious, financial, social or legal interests.  You could decide at a later date to file for divorce which would end the marriage.  A legal separation is not required as a step on the way to getting a divorce.

						Q(1.1.1.1.1.2.1): You can separate informally without going to court by making your own arrangements with your spouse.

	Q(1.2): Which of these best describes your situation?  [Note to Shandan: this is the weakest section of my decision tree, a rough attempt at providing information within the experience to help people choose which option is best. It also raises a question that is going to be repeated throughout the experience: how do we give people small amounts of information about multiple options, within the curated experience, so they can pick one option and end up with the right action plan?]
